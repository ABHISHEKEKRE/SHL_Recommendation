Individual Test Solutions,Global Skills Assessment,The Global Skills Assessment (GSA) is an assessment used to measure 96 discrete skills/behaviors. These 96 skill scores are directly aligned to the most discrete level of SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (UCF). The GSA measures self-reported behaviors an individual currently engages in. A person’s skills (sets of behavior) are malleable and may change over time. SHL utilizes GSA scores to understand what the participant reports they can do today.,[],"['Arabic', 'Chinese Simplified', 'Chinese Traditional', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'English (USA)', 'Finnish', 'French', 'French (Canada)', 'German', 'Indonesian', 'Italian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Latin American Spanish', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Romanian', 'Spanish', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Turkish', 'Vietnamese']",16,"['C', 'K']",1,0,"Global Skills Assessment (GSA)

Overview The Global Skills Assessment (GSA) is designed to measure the 96 universal skills,
as identified within SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (UCF). The UCF is a
structured and evidence-based competency framework that provides a rational,
consistent, and practical basis for understanding people’s behavior at work and
their likelihood of success. The most detailed level of the UCF consists of SHL’s
universal skills taxonomy. The Global Skills Assessment measures each of these 96
skills, providing a comprehensive understanding of workplace behavior.

Measured
The GSA measures universal skills, or patterns of workplace behavior relevant to
different job roles. The GSA can help organizations:
• Identify the applicants with behavioral skills already suited to job roles
• Identify incumbent strengths and growth areas
• Redeploy talent across the business
The GSA is not available by itself for stand-alone off the shelf use, but is available in
JFAs, for use with the Skills Development Report, and for use with a custom report.
Reports for the GSA are designed to ensure that results can be meaningfully
interpreted and understood in business contexts. The reports are designed for use
in business by managers, trained HR professionals, or participants and provide:
• Targeted, user-friendly and professional formats
• Clear, concise language with easy-to-understand graphical summaries
• Insightful information to use across multiple contexts

Technical Manual Supplement
Test Reliability For Linux Operating System, the initial question bank had 26 items and 4 unique test forms. Item
analysis was carried out on a sample of 2687 candidates who had a bachelor's or master's degree. Test
forms with low reliability (<0.55) were removed. The average reliability (Cronbach alpha) of the final test
forms was 0.57 and the test form with minimum reliability had an alpha of 0.52. The final question bank
post this analysis had 25 items and 3 unique test forms that were of comparable reliability and similar in
mean and standard deviation. Where required, we do linear equating of test forms.
Normative The table below includes information regarding the mean and standard deviation of the Linux Operating
Information System assessment. The sample size (N) for which these estimates were taken is also included. The
following test norms have been formulated solely based on data from India. A global norm will be
established as soon as additional data becomes available.
Sample Size (N) Mean Standard Deviation
2034 63.50 21.60
Test Development The Linux Operating System assessment was developed following the rigorous process outlined in our
Technology Hiring Multiple Choice Questionnaire Skills Tests technical manual. This process involves 4
comprehensive phases, followed by ongoing maintenance and quality assurance procedures. At a high
level, the development process includes several key steps: recruiting subject matter experts (SMEs),
collaborating with them to define the outcome or objective used for measuring and comparing test
takers, creating a test blueprint that specifies domain areas and testing outcomes within each domain,
thoroughly reviewing and editing test questions, gathering data from a representative sample of test
takers, and conducting the necessary analyses for administering the Linux Operating System skills
test. For a full description of these phases, please refer to Chapter 3 in the Technology Hiring Multiple
Choice Questionnaire Skills Tests technical manual.

A car dealership lowered all of its car prices by 15%.
Ability Sample
Question
Given the above information, what was the original price of a car now priced at £9500?
A. £8075.00
B. £10,925.00
C. £11,000.00
D. £11,176.47
E. £12,322.13
To answer the question, the candidate must calculate the full price of the car before the 15% discount.
The price £9500 is 85% of the full price (100%-15%). So, the calculation is the cost of the car post-
discount divided by 85 (to find 1% of the full price), then multiplied by 100 to obtain the full cost pre-
discount. So the answer is D: £11,176.47
Deductive
Review the facts below.
Reasoning
 Jane drives a red car.
Sample
 Susan drives a blue car.
Question  There are no red cars in Ohio.
 Blue cars get 33 miles per gallon of gasoline.
Based on the information above, which of the following MUST be true?
1. Jane lives in Ohio.
2. Susan lives in Ohio.
3. Red cars get 36 miles per gallon of gasoline.
4. Susan’s car gets 33 miles per gallon of gasoline.
5. Jane and Susan live in the same state.
The correct answer is D. Since blue cars get 33 miles per gallon of gas, the fact that Susan drives a blue
car means that her car gets 33 miles per gallon of gas.

A. £8075.00 B. £10,925.00 C. £11,000.00 D. £11,176.47 E. £12,322.13 To answer the question, the candidate must calculate the full price of the car before the 15% discount. The price £9500 is 85% of the full price (100%-15%). So, the calculation is the cost of the car post- discount divided by 85 (to find 1% of the full price), then multiplied by 100 to obtain the full cost pre- discount. So the answer is D: £11,176.47 Deductive Review the facts below. Reasoning  Jane drives a red car. Sample  Susan drives a blue car. Question  There are no red cars in Ohio.  Blue cars get 33 miles per gallon of gasoline. Based on the information above, which of the following MUST be true? 1. Jane lives in Ohio. 2. Susan lives in Ohio. 3. Red cars get 36 miles per gallon of gasoline. 4. Susan’s car gets 33 miles per gallon of gasoline. 5. Jane and Susan live in the same state. The correct answer is D. Since blue cars get 33 miles per gallon of gas, the fact that Susan drives a blue car means that her car gets 33 miles per gallon of gas. Inductive Reasoning Sample Question The correct answer is C. Each row contains 1 of 5 different shapes in no particular order. The only shape missing in the 4th row is a triangle and the only shape missing in the 5th row is a circle.  |","['8075.00', 'cars', 'skills', 'infer', 'shapes', 'review', 'inferences', 'score', 'cost', 'weaknesses', 'minutes', '10,925.00', 'overview', 'allowed', 'adaptive', 'miles', 'title', 'numerical', 'situations', 'shape', 'testing', 'candidate', 'state', 'susan', 'allowed time', 'jane', 'sheet', 'generalizations', 'prices', 'questions', 'deductive review', 'aptitude', 'jobs', 'candidates', 'tables', 'price', 'unproctored', 'individuals', 'answer', 'discount', '11,000.00', 'details', 'data', 'skills, abilities', 'dealership', 'roles', 'test', 'product', 'processes', 'gallon', 'circle', 'gasoline', 'regularities', 'reasoning', 'average', 'format', 'tasks', 'rules', 'computations', 'individual', 'question', 'sample', 'number', 'inductive', 'tests', 'verify', 'setting', 'suite', 'administration', 'yes', 'choice', 'indication', 'knowledge', 'information', 'triangle', 'conclusions', 'figures', '11,176.47', 'decisions', 'abilities', 'solutions', 'problems', 'order', 'arguments', 'job', 'family', 'car', 'levels', 'charts', 'fact', 'graphs', 'patterns', 'calculation', 'nature', 'methods', 'ability', 'deductive', 'competencies', 'adaptive product category ability & aptitude knowledge', 'shorter', 'scenarios', 'environment', 'multiple', 'types', 'decision', 'row', 'benefits', 'errors', 'gas', 'part', 'maximum', 'strengths', 'technology', 'job family / title verify details average testing time', 'category', 'making', 'thinking', 'facts', 'ohio', 'computer', 'time', 'work']","['General Population', 'Graduate', 'Manager', 'Mid-Professional', 'Professional Individual Contributor', 'Supervisor', 'Director', 'Entry-Level', 'Executive', 'Front Line Manager']","['Romanian', 'English (USA)', 'English International', 'French (Canada)', 'Latin American Spanish', 'Arabic', 'Dutch', 'French', 'German', 'Swedish', 'Chinese Simplified', 'Chinese Traditional', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Greek', 'Hungarian', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese', 'Thai', 'Turkish', 'Finnish', 'Japanese', 'Spanish', 'Indonesian', 'Russian', 'Slovak', 'Serbian', 'Portuguese (Brazil)', 'Vietnamese']",['Ability'],36,"verify -
